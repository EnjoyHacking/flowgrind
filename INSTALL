                             Compiling flowgrind
                             ===================

Dependencies
============

Flowgrind depends on the following tools and libraries:
- libxmlrpc-c with curl transport and abyss server
- libpcap (currently not used, therefore disabled by default)
- TSC-I2 (optional, seems to be unmaintained, will be removed soon)
- GNU Autotools (autoconf, automake and friends) if using source from 
  the SVN repository

These libraries as well as their headers and tools need to be installed 
(install approciate -dev packages too).

Building flowgrind
==================

1. a) Extract source tarball OR
   b) Checkout flowgrind from the SVN repository
      (e.g. svn co svn://svn.umic-mesh.net/flowgrind/trunk)

2. cd into the flowgrind directory

3. Only if using a copy from the SVN repositry run
     autoreconf -i

4. Run  ./configure  to build the makefiles. If this step fails, you are
   missing a working compiler toolchain or some dependencies. Analyze the
   output of configure for more information.
   Read  ./configure --help  for a list of supported options

5. Run  make  to compile flowgrind. This creates src/flowgrind and src/flowgrindd

6. Optionally run (sudo)  make install  to copy the binaries to the installation prefix.
