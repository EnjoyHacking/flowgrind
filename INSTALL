                             Compiling flowgrind
                             ===================

Dependencies
============

Flowgrind depends on the following tools and libraries:
- GNU Autotools (autoconf, automake and friends) (aptitude install build-essential)
- libxmlrpc-c with curl transport and abyss server (aptitude install libxmlrpc-c3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev)

These libraries as well as their headers and tools need to be installed
(install approciate -dev packages too).

The following depencies are optional and only required for advanced features:
- libpcap (for automatic dump, optional) (aptitude install libpcap0.8-dev)
- libgsl (for advanced traffic generation, optional) (aptitude install libgsl0-dev)

Building flowgrind
==================

1. a) Extract source tarball OR
   b) Checkout flowgrind from the SVN repository
      (e.g. svn co svn://svn.umic-mesh.net/flowgrind/trunk)

2. cd into the flowgrind directory

3. Only if using a copy from the SVN repositry run
     autoreconf -i

4. Run  ./configure  to build the makefiles. If this step fails, you are
   missing a working compiler toolchain or some dependencies. Analyze the
   output of configure for more information.
   Read  ./configure --help  for a list of supported options.

   e.g. disable libgsl and libpcap with: --disable-gsl --disable-pcap

5. Run make to compile flowgrind. This creates src/flowgrind and src/flowgrindd

6. Optionally run (sudo) make install  to copy the binaries to the installation prefix.

Hint: If you encounter something like 

"XML-RPC Fault: RPC failed at server.  No member of struct has key 'num_extra_socket_options' (-502)"

it's probably related to different xmlrpc-c versions on client and server and not a flowgrind bug.
