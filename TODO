+rewrite all the timing code to not contain struct timeval anymore but just relative times (jiffies like)
+unify client/server
+recover UDP option
+check what DEBUG_MSGs might be worth a "real" message
+(try to)track route changes (IP route record option)
+add DCCP/SCTP support
+add control connection less mode (-T: traffic only)
+fix 32/64-, network/host byte order issues
+sendfile() support (open("/dev/zero") at first)
+use urgend data for reporting? (maybe even SIGIO)
+functions to generate sending rate
+request/response test
+meet more the spirit of IPPM (connectivity test, etc.)
+fix inter arival time calculation for rate limited flows
+for rate rate limited flows make receiving peer check if the inter arrival times are distributed as choosen 
+add sequence numbers for block (even tcp) to meassure application level throuput (and to disclose aggregate queue capacity along network path)
+more timing precision!
+save whole RTT/IAT distribution
+allow send volume to be specified (instead of duration/rate)
