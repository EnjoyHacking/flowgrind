+allow setsockopt of SO_DEBUG, TCP_ICMP, TCP_ELCN etc.. independently on server and client  [arnd 07.03.08]
+recover UDP option
+check what DEBUG_MSGs might be worth a "real" message
+(try to)track route changes (IP route record option)
+add DCCP/SCTP support
+add reply-connection-less mode (-T: traffic only)
+sendfile() support (open("/dev/zero") at first). sendfile() is special case of splice() in recent Linux versions
+functions to generate sending rate
+allow send volume to be specified (instead of duration/rate)
+request/response test
+meet more the spirit of IPPM (connectivity test, etc.)
+save whole RTT/IAT distribution
+for rate rate limited flows make receiving peer check if the inter arrival times are distributed as choosen 
+add sequence numbers for block (even tcp) to meassure application level throuput (and to disclose aggregate queue capacity along network path)
+rewrite all the timing code to not contain struct timeval anymore but just relative times (jiffies like)
+more timing precision! (for most precise scheduling the processing thread would need realtime priority. The RPC thread must have lower priority)
