Bugs / known issues
+ investigate why libpcap does not work in multiple threads
+ tcpdumping is currently broken
+ fix option -F (comma separation doesn't work)
+ investigate why flowgrindd burns so much CPU (in comparison to netperf)
+ final report is build from averages of averages, which is mathematically wrong 
+ investigate why delay and RTT values (in comparison to netperf values)

Features
+ truncate values for interpacket gap 
+ add some way of specifying normal distribution to -R
+ add interleaving threshold
+ do something with UDP/SCTP
+ add new socket opions of Linux 3.13 / FreeBSD 10
+ allow to send amount of bytes instead duration
+ add optional columns for sender/receiver buffer
+ implement pthread barrier for mac os x
+ display CPU utilization
+ allow delay and RTT measurements that are independent of the block size

Coding style / documenting
+ simplify arbitrary socket options
+ add c style comments to functions for doxygen help
+ do not call /sbin/sysctl out of flowgrind
+ apply Linux kernel coding style
+ only display RTT/transac column (and calculated values) upon reverse traffic
+ adapt man pages to the newest changes in help
+ improve output for heterogeneous OS-Environments
+ revisit all debug/log/error messages (content and level)
+ write own argpaser (and argmatch) to allow mutual exclusion options
+ write common functions for time representation
+ Deprecate usage of sprintf and vsprintf
