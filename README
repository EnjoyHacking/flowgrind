                                  Flowgrind
                                  =========

flowgrind grinds flows among hosts in your network.

See INSTALL for instructions how to build flowgrind.

Execute 'flowgrind -h' for a list of supported options.

Instructions to run a test
==========================

1. Start  flowgrindd  on all machines that should be the endpoint of a flow.
2. Execute  flowgrind  on some machine (not necessarily one of the endpoints)
   with the host names of the endpoints passed through the -H option. 

Example
=======

Assume we have 4 machines, host0, host1, host2 and host3 and flowgrind has
been installed on all of them.
We want to measure flows from host1 to host2 and from host1 to host2 in
parallel. First start flowgrindd on host1-host3. One some machine we then
execute the following command, for example host0:

# flowgrind -n 2 -F 0 -H s=host1,d=host2 -F 1 s=host1,d=host3
