                                  Flowgrind
                                  =========

flowgrind grinds flows among hosts in your network.

See INSTALL for instructions how to build flowgrind.

Execute 'flowgrind -h' for a list of supported options.

Instructions to run a test
==========================

1. Start  flowgrindd  on all machines that should be the endpoint of a flow.
2. Execute  flowgrind  on some machine (not necessarily one of the endpoints)
   with the host names of the endpoints passed through the -H option. 

Example
-------

Assume we have 4 machines, host0, host1, host2 and host3 and flowgrind has
been installed on all of them.
We want to measure flows from host1 to host2 and from host1 to host2 in
parallel. First start flowgrindd on host1-host3. One some machine we then
execute the following command, for example host0:

# flowgrind -n 2 -F 0 -H s=host1,d=host2 -F 1 s=host1,d=host3

Host argument
=============

There are three types of connections flowgrind uses:
- The test connection for the flows
- The reply connection for the flows where the block IAT and RTT information
  get sent back
- The RPC connections for the communication between flowgrind and flowgrindd

In order not to influence the test connection, the other two connection types
can be sent over different interfaces/routes. There are three addresses: The
test address, the RPC address and the reply address. An unspecified RPC
address falls back to the test address and an unspecified reply address falls
back to the RPC address.

This is important for the host argument:
  -H x=HOST[/RPCADDRESS[:PORT][/REPLYADDRESS]]

Specifying a reply address is only needed for the destination, it has no
effect on the source endpoint.

Example
-------

Assume two machines running flowgrindd, each having two network adapters, one
wired, one wireless. We run flowgrind on a machine that is connected by wire
to the test machines.
First machine has addresses 10.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1, the other has addresses
10.0.0.2 and 192.168.0.1

So our host argument will be this:
  -H s=192.168.0.1/10.0.0.1,d=192.168.0.2/10.0.0.2

In words: Test from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.2 on the nodes identified by
10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 respectively. Since we didn't specify a reply address,
the reply connection will also use 10.0.0.2
